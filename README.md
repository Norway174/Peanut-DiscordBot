# Peanut Discord Bot
Just a general all-purpose utility Discord bot. This bot is designed for use only on my own personal channel. But feel free to use this code to learn and make your own. Coded for Node.JS.

The bot is still being worked on, but already now, she has some cool features;

### Features
* Commands - The default prefix is '#'. But tagging the bot will also register as a prefix for all the commands.
* Widgets - Self-updating messages with new relevant information. For example, a Minecraft server checked. Will update X ammount of minutes and display the latest server stats. Such as if the server is online, and how many players are currently online.
* Automatic Minecraft whitelist & sync. _(Advanced)_

### Commands

* Help - Displays a list of all avalible commands.
* Ping - Pings the bot, to test the response time.
* Joke - Tells a funny joke.
* Poll - Creates a simple poll. With a set time, and people can vote by reactions.
* Dice - Dice rolling. Can roll a simple D20. Or you can make advanced dice rolls.
* Translate - Translates from one language to another.
* Convert - Convert from one currency to another.
* Steam - Search the Steam library.
* Check - Checks the status of a Minecraft server. And if the server is online, displays a list of who is connected.
* FiveM - Same as Check, but for the GTA V multiplayer mod called FiveM.
* Role-reactor - Set a message to act as a role reactor. Where people can react with an emote to a message, to add or remove a certain role automatically.
